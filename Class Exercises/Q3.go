/*
You're developing a weather monitoring system in GoLang for a research institute.
The system needs to store data about temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Define variables to hold these measurements for a specific location at a given point in time.
Ensure you choose suitable data types for representing numerical measurements accurately.
